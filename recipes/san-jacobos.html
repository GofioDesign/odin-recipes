<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 slices of cooked ham</li>
<li>4 slices of vegan cheese</li>
<li>1 cup of glutenfree breadcrumbs</li>
<li>2 eggs (egg substitute)</li>
<li>Â½ cup of flour</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Assemble the San Jacobos: Place a slice of cheese between two slices of ham, pressing gently to keep them together. Repeat for the remaining slices.</li>
<li>Prepare the coating: In three separate bowls, place flour in one, beaten eggs in another, and breadcrumbs in the last one.</li>
<li>Coat the ham and cheese: Lightly season the assembled ham and cheese with salt and pepper. Dip each piece into the flour, ensuring it is fully coated. Then, dip it into the beaten egg, and finally, cover it with breadcrumbs, pressing gently to make the coating stick well.<li>
<li>Fry to perfection: Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, fry each San Jacobo for about 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
<li>Drain and serve: Remove from the oil and place on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve hot with your favorite side dishes.</li>
