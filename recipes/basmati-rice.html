<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Basmati rice is a long-grain variety known for its delicate aroma and fluffy texture. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, it is widely used in dishes like biryanis, pilafs, and side servings for curries. Its unique ability to remain separate and non-sticky after cooking makes it a favorite choice for many cuisines around the world.</p>
<p>Cooking basmati rice properly requires the right technique to enhance its natural fragrance and light texture. When prepared correctly, it has a slightly nutty flavor and a soft yet firm bite. Whether served with rich, spicy dishes or enjoyed on its own, basmati rice is a staple that complements a variety of meals.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of basmati rice</li>
<li>2 cups of water</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon of salt (optional)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of oil or butter (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the rice: Wash the basmati rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents it from becoming sticky.</li>
<li>Soak the rice: Let the rice soak in water for about 20-30 minutes. This helps achieve longer, fluffier grains after cooking. Drain before cooking.</li>
<li>Boil the water: In a pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add salt and oil or butter if desired.<li>
<li>Cook the rice: Add the drained rice to the boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes until the water is absorbed.</li>
<li>Let it rest: Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. This allows the steam to finish cooking the rice.</li>
<li>Fluff and serve: Use a fork to gently fluff the rice before serving. Enjoy with your favorite dish!</li>
